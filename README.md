# Ore blending problem

> Final project for course "Metaheuristics in Combinatorial Optimization"

## 💻 Introduction

This project describes and tests an approach for the ore blending problem. A Late Acceptance Hill Climbing method is implemented aiming to optimize the process of blending the ore before distribution. The goal is to minimize the cost and also get as close as possible to the established concentration goals for each chemical compound analised. 

## 🚀 The project

The final article can be found with name "Artigo Mistura de Minério". A study of the literature was conducted and the article contains an introduction to the problem as well a description of the proposed methodology, experiments and a conclusion.
